# MathConvert
HackTheU (University of Utah's hackathon) 2017 project. Recognizes handwritten numerical digits (the goal was to recognize mathematical operators as well as digits, and to convert them to typed characters, but we ran out of time to train the model on operator symbols).

This is a web application, with a front end created with Angular/TypeScript, a back end created in Django, and the underlying model/neural net created using the Keras API in Python. 

The server hosting the web application may be down, but the URL is: https://maaaaaaaaaaaaath.com/draw
